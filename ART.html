            I drew this in art class, it is a symmetry drawing. 
            A symmetry is a that has two same sides. 
            I used an app called sketchbook to draw this drawing. 
            In the app I used a thing that makes two sides the same. 
            I enjoyed drawing all the circles, it made me relax. 
            If I could do this again I will put in more colors.
