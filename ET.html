            I made this 3D pencil using a website called Tinkercad. 
            When I want to print this model I can copy the link of the model and put it on a 3D printer, altho I did not print it. 
            I think one of my struggles was that the cone, 
            the part that the color came out, did not line up very well.

    <div class="box">
        <h2>Worm</h2>
        <Div>
            <img src="worm.HEIC" height="200px">
        </Div>
        <p>
            I made this 3D worm in ET class. 
            I printed this worm in tinkercad and then built the secret from microbit. 
            I made an arm to push the front of the worm so it can move but it can only front. 
            In the code I made it to turn the arm every 1 second it was very slow. 
            I struggled with the worm moving because it moved but did not go forward so I put double sided tape to make it stick on the ground. 
            If I do this again I will make it bigger and faster.

    <div class="box">
        <h2>bishop</h2>
        <Div>
            <img src="chess.png" height="200px">
        </Div>
        <p>
            I made this bishop in ET with tinkercad. 
            Tinkercad is a website where we can make 3D models. 
            It was a little hard making the face because it is a circle and a triangle together. 
            When I was making this project I only looked at a picture and made it. 
            I really enjoyed making it because it was fun watching the picture and making it. 
            if i can make it again I will make the bottom smaller.
