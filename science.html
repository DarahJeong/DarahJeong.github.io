        <p>
            This amusement park is based on organelles from cells both plant and animal. 
            When I was doing this I got to know more about the organelles function. 
            It was kind of hard to get all the information for the organelles. 
            When I was working on this project I liked drawing the map, 
            also it was interesting to learn about all the organelles. 
            If I could work on this project again I would draw more rides and put in more color.

        <p>
            This elevator is based on simple machines. 
            We used popsicle sticks for the base of the elevator and straws for the bars. 
            Also we used string and a stick to make the elevator move. 
            In this project it was hard sticking the straws on the base of the elevator. 
            If I could do this project again I want to make it more organized.
